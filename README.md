MyVoiceNG is a ES6/ES7 React/Node Stack
===================================

Based on awesome work by Frederic Heem at [https://github.com/FredericHeem/](https://github.com/FredericHeem/).

Fullstack web application stack written in es6/es7 and node.js with the following features:

* Authentication: username/password, facebook, google authentication etc ...
* Authorization: scheme using user, group and permission  
* Scalable by using a micro services based architecture, a.k.a message queues
* Relational database: postgres, mysql, sqlite, mssql etc, ...
* Logging

## Docker containers

To install the docker containers for the various services such as RabbitMq and Postgres on the local machine, the [DevLab](https://github.com/TechnologyAdvice/DevLab) project is being used to containerize the development workflow, see its configuration file: [devlab.yml](server/devlab.yml)


    # cd server
    # npm run devlabinstall

To check that the containers are running:

```
# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                         NAMES
ccd9f559fabd        rabbitmq:latest     "/docker-entrypoint.s"   36 minutes ago      Up 36 minutes       4369/tcp, 25672/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5672->5672/tcp   devlab_rabbitmq_frederic_1446641005596
```

**Note regarding Mac OS X:** If you are using Docker under Mac OS X, your containers will run in a virtual machine instead of your Mac directly. You need to go through the services (e.g. ```"rabbitmq"```) defined in ```server/config/default.json``` (or whichever file you are currently using) and set them to the IP that is mapped to your Docker VM.

## Backend

To start the backend:

    # cd server
    # npm install
    # npm start

To test the backend:

    # npm test

It will not only test the code, but also checks the source code with eslint and generates a code coverage report located at `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

For more information about the backend, see its [README](server/README.md)

## Deployment

See [Ansible README.md](deploy/ansible/README.md)
